###Overview
Node.js project. Backend used to serve the page and hit translation APIs. Frontend used for user input and sending data to the server.

In ENGL 216, we discussed translations of literature and the implications of reading translated text. Like the phone game, sometimes meaning is lost after a series of translations. Some web apps like [Translation Party] take a phrase and translate it for a certain amount of times. Lost In Translation does something similar. With this app you can translate a phrase into any language using two different translation APIs. A phrase or series of phrases are translated six times back and forth between the source and target language. At the end, the original text and the final translated text are compared showing how different APIs and languages translate back and forth.

###APIs
We were able to find two translate APIs with easy and quick to use response data in the form of JSON. Currently we support all Google Translate languages, some of which Yandex does not support.

*Google Translate API
*Yandex
